# Video_Based_Guitarist_Performance

Currently, it is an unfinished project. More files and examples will be uploaded later on.

This project aims to classify the performance of a guitarist according to his/her finger gesture in 2D. Now, the model is able to achieve around 70% accuracy.

# Library Involved:

OpenCV
1. Frame-by-frame video processing
2. Hand keypoints detection using pretrained Caffa model

PyTorch
1. The deep learning framework responses for the training of perfermance classifier
